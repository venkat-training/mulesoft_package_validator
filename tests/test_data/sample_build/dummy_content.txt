This is a dummy file inside the 'sample_build' directory.
Its purpose is to ensure that the 'calculate_build_size' function,
when called with 'tests/test_data/sample_build', returns a size greater than zero.
This file needs to have some content for os.path.getsize() to report a non-zero size.
Adding a bit more text to be sure.
Hello, world! Testing build size calculation.
This should be enough.
